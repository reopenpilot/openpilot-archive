Using openpilot in a car
------

To use openpilot in a car, you need four things:
1. **Supported Device:** a comma 3/3X, available at [comma.ai/shop](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x).
2. **Software:** The setup procedure for the comma 3/3X allows users to enter a URL for custom software. Use the URL `openpilot.comma.ai` to install the release version.
3. **Supported Car:** Ensure that you have one of [the 275+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md).
4. **Car Harness:** You will also need a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) to connect your comma 3/3X to your car.

We have detailed instructions for [how to install the harness and device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup). Note that it's possible to run openpilot on [other hardware](https://blog.comma.ai/self-driving-car-for-free/), although it's not plug-and-play.

**FrogPilot** is a custom frog-themed fork of openpilot that embraces a collaborative, community-driven approach to push the project forward. It delivers bleeding-edge features and experimental improvements far ahead of official releases. As an unofficial and highly experimental version of openpilot, **FrogPilot** should always be used with caution!

üåü Highlight Features
------

### üöó Always On Lateral (AOL)

With **"Always On Lateral"**, lane-centering stays active whenever cruise control is on, even when you press the accelerator or brake. This means steering assist won't cut out during manual speed adjustments giving you continuous support through curves, traffic, or mountain roads!

---

### üß† Conditional Experimental Mode (CEM)

**["Experimental Mode"](https://blog.comma.ai/090release/#experimental-mode)** lets openpilot drive at the speed it thinks a human would to allow slowing for curves, stopping at stoplights/stop signs, and adapting to traffic. This makes it powerful in complex scenarios, but it's still, well, "experimental" and less predictable than **"Chill Mode"**. But **"Conditional Experimental Mode"** gives you the best of both worlds by automatically switching between **"Chill Mode"** for steady cruising and **"Experimental Mode"** for more advanced situations to help fully automate your driving experience!

**"Conditional Experimental Mode"** switches into **"Experimental Mode"** when conditions like these are met:
- Approaching curves and turns
- Detecting slower or stopped lead vehicles
- Driving below a set speed
- Predicting an upcoming stop (e.g. stoplight or stop sign)

Once conditions clear it returns to **"Chill Mode"** for stability and predictability.

**Note: Stay attentive as "Experimental Mode" is an alpha feature and mistakes are expected!**

---

### üé≠ Driving Personalities

With **"Driving Personalities"**, you choose how the vehicle behaves with four adjustable profiles:

- **Traffic:** Catered towards stop-and-go traffic by minimizing gaps and delays  
- **Aggressive:** Aimed to provide tighter following distances and quicker reactions  
- **Standard:** Useful for a balanced, all-purpose driving  
- **Relaxed:** A smoother driving experience with larger following distance gaps  

Each profile can be fine-tuned to change the desired following distance, acceleration, and braking style letting you shape **FrogPilot**'s behavior to match your own driving preferences! Profiles can be switched instantly using the following distance button on the steering wheel, while **"Traffic Mode"** can be enabled by simply holding down the following distance button.

---

### üìè Speed Limit Controller (SLC)

With **"Speed Limit Controller"**, **FrogPilot** automatically adapts to the road's posted speed using information from downloaded **["OpenStreetMap"](https://www.openstreetmap.org)** maps, online **["Mapbox"](https://www.mapbox.com)** data, and the vehicle's dashboard (if supported).

Offsets let you fine-tune how closely **FrogPilot** follows posted limits across different speed ranges allowing you to cruise slightly above or below for a more natural driving experience. If no speed limit is available, you can choose whether **FrogPilot** drives at the set speed, falls back to the last known speed limit, or uses **"Experimental Mode"** to estimate one with the driving model.

Maps can be downloaded directly in settings and updated automatically on a schedule ensuring your device always has the latest speed limits!

**Note: Speed limits are only as accurate as the available speed limit data. Always stay attentive and adjust your speed when necessary!**

---

### üé® Themes

With **"Themes"**, you can personalize **FrogPilot**'s driving screen to make it uniquely yours! Choose from:

- **Color Schemes**
- **Icon Packs**
- **Sound Packs**
- **Turn Signal Animations**
- **Steering Wheel Icons**

Enjoy pre-existing **FrogPilot** and seasonal holiday themes, or you can create your own with the **"Theme Maker"** and even share them with the community! For extra fun, enable features like the Mario Kart‚Äìstyle **"Rainbow Path"** or **"Random Events"** that add playful visual effects while you drive!

And lots more! From safety enhancements to personalization options, **FrogPilot** continues to evolve with features that put you in control. Check it out today for yourself!

üß∞ How to Install
------

The easiest way to install **FrogPilot** is by entering this URL on the installation screen:

```
frogpilot.download
```

**DO NOT** install the **FrogPilot-Development** branch. I'm constantly breaking things on there, so unless you don't want to use **FrogPilot**, **NEVER** install it!
